                    <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;procedural justice&rsquo;&#133;assumes that the police are neutrally enforcing a set of laws that are automatically beneficial to everyone. Instead of questioning the validity of using police to wage an inherently racist war on drugs, advocates of &lsquo;procedural justice&rsquo; politely suggest that police get anti-bias training, which they will happily deliver for no small fee.&rdquo;

                    <p>“In a newly colonised country like Australia, the police served the additional purpose of protecting and supporting the expansion of the colony into the new lands of inland Australia. Again, it is clear that this role made the police the protectors, if not the enforcers, of the dispossession and the genocide against the Indigenous people.”
