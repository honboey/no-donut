Does Australia have a policing problem too?,https://www.abc.net.au/radio/programs/the-signal/does-australia-have-a-policing-problem-too/12318430,"""Policing is all about power...and if we're going to look at power asymmetries, we need to look at the over-policing and over-criminalistaion of Indigenous communitites. The development of the police in Australia was overtly violent in terms of its role to secure and dispossess Aboriginal people of their land, so that it could be stolen. That is the reality of the violence of policing in this country.""",Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC),audio,Audio (16min 16sec)
"The answer to policing violence is not ""reform"". It's defunding. Here's why.",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/31/the-answer-to-police-violence-is-not-reform-its-defunding-heres-why,"""Procedural justice"" assumes that the police are neutrally enforcing a set of laws that are automatically beneficial to everyone. Instead of questioning the validity of using police to wage an inherently racist war on drugs, advocates of ""Procedural justice"" politely suggest that police get anti-bias training, which they will happily deliver for no small fee.",The Guardian,text,"Article (770 words, 4min)"
Defunding the police could bring positive change in Australia. These communities are showing the way.,https://theconversation.com/defunding-the-police-could-bring-positive-change-in-australia-these-communities-are-showing-the-way-140333,"""An independent evaluation conducted in 2018 by KPMG found dramatic reductions in reported incidences of domestic violence (and re-offending), juvenile offending, breaches of bail and the number of days spent in custody. The positive outcomes also went beyond the criminal justice system. For example, the youth development programs in Bourke have coincided with a 31% increase in year 12 student retention rates.""",The Conversation,text,"Article (961 words, 4min)"

Indigenous  deaths in custody: report summary.,https://humanrights.gov.au/our-work/indigenous-deaths-custody-report-summary,"""Many Indigenous people are being placed in custody for trivial offences. Offensive language charges and the trifecta are two ways in which this happens. Police initiated interventions result in the laying of charges – typically using offensive language, resisting arrest and assaulting police ( or similar offences). The relatively high proportion of Indigenous prisoners incarcerated for assault occasioning no actual bodily harm is indicative of the trifecta phenomenon – 12 per cent against 4 per cent for the general prison population.""",Australian Human Rights Commission,text,"Article (3,182 words, 14min)"
Are the police workers like the rest of us?,https://www.workerssolidarity.org.au/analysis_arepoliceworkers,"""In a newly colonised country like Australia, the police served the additional purpose of protecting and supporting the expansion of the colony into the new lands of inland Australia. Again, it is clear that this role made the police the protectors, if not the enforcers, of the dispossession and the genocide against the Indigenous people.""",Workers Solidarity,text,"Article (660 words, 3min)"
